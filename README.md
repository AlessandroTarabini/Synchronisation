# Synchronisation

Codes used to run the synchronisation for HIG-21-009 (differential analysis)

The only file to run jobs on condor is condorSubmissionYEAR.sh

Inside these files the user should define the miniAOD name and the production modes list

After the jobs are completed, to create the dump files the user should run produceDumpFiles.sh
